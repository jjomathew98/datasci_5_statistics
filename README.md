### For the purpose of this assignment, I used data from : https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hantswilliams/HHA_507_2023/main/WK5/examples/data/nys-opioid-visits/All_Payer_Opioid-Related_Facility_Visits_in_New_York_State__Beginning_2010__SPARCS_.csv 

## 1. Chi-Square Test:
#### From the significant p-value, we can conclude that there is a relationship between the Payer and Rural/Urban variables. In other words, the type of payer is associated with whether the area is rural or urban. The chi-squared test suggests that these variables are not independent of each other in the given dataset.

## 2. T Test
#### The strategy we use for the purpose of interpretation is: If the p-value is less than your chosen significance level (e.g., 0.05), you would reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is a significant difference in ER Visits per 1000 people between rural and urban areas. If the p-value is greater than 0.05, you would fail to reject the null hypothesis, suggesting that there is not enough evidence to conclude a significant difference in ER Visits between rural and urban areas.
#### Since P-value is greater than 0.05 we can say that we would fail to reject the null hypothesis, suggesting that there is not enough evidence to conclude a significant difference in ER Visits between rural and urban areas.

## 3. Anova
### Mean Opioid Usage Rates by Payer:
#### Commercial payer type has the highest mean opioid usage rate (48.24 per 1000 patients), followed by Medicaid (55.41), Medicare (28.63), Other (2.77), and Unknown (1.37). This aligns with the ANOVA results, suggesting a significant difference in opioid usage rates among payer types.

### Conclusion:
#### Based on the small p-values in the ANOVA table, we can reject the null hypotheses for 'payer', 'rural_urban', and their interaction. This means there are significant differences in opioid usage rates among different payer types and between Rural and Urban areas, as well as differences in the impact of payer types on opioid usage rates in different geographic areas.

## 4. Regression Analysis
#### For the regression analysis we are choosing the relationship between the number of outpatient visits (independent variable) and the overall rate per 1000 (dependent variable) related to healthcare
### Null Hypothesis (H0): The number of outpatient visits does not predict the overall rate per 1000 related to healthcare.
### Alternative Hypothesis (H1): The number of outpatient visits predicts the overall rate per 1000 related to healthcare.

### Interpretation
#### Based on the regression analysis and the high p-value for the coefficient of outpatient visits, there is not enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis. The number of outpatient visits does not appear to be a significant predictor of the overall rate per 1000 related to healthcare in this dataset. The relationship between these variables is weak, and the number of outpatient visits alone does not provide a meaningful prediction of the overall rate per 1000.
